# tetris
{EPITECH} | First year | Unix System programming project

The goal of this project is to recreate the Tetris game in a UNIX terminal, with the Gameboy version rules.You have to use ncurses.

In the folder of your binary, there must be atetriminosdirectory, which contains files that describe the gamepieces.

These files are composed in the following way :

- on the first line, the size and color of the piece in this format:width height color_code\n(the numberof the color corresponds to the ncurses capacity’s color numbers),

- on thehfollowing lines (wherehis the height of the tetrimino), the piece’s shape composed withasterisks (*) and spaces (‘ ’).

See the subject for further details !
